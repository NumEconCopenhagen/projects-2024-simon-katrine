# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model with productive externalities**. In the following project we model the Solow Model with semi-endogenous and endogenous growth to technology. We have positive spill-over from capital to technology. Meaning when capital rises there is a positive externality to technology, which will impact GDP positive. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install plotly``
``pip install ipywidgets``
