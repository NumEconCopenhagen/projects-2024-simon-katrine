# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **The Phillips curve**. We investigate the correlation between unemployment and inflation in Denmark from 2007-2023. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**: 

1. PRIS113.csv (*statistikbanken.dk*) 
2. AUS09.csv (*statistikbanken.dk*)

Make sure that PRIS113 is downloaded.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install plotly_express``
``pip install seaborn``
``pip install pandas-datareader``
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``

We find that there is no clear correlation between unemployment rate and inflation, and therefore the Phillips Curve do not allign with the empirical data from the period 2007-2023.
